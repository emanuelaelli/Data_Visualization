This university project is aimed at creating visualizations (interactive and static) to visually represent the data within a dataset.

The phases carried out for this project are: cleaning the dataset, creating the views, heuristic evaluation of the views, evaluation (after the improvements made in the previous phase) through a questionnaire.

The tools used are: python, tableau, figma.

The data was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/ for educational purposes.
